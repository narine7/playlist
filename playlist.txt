Isolate work in progress from the completed work in your main branch
Guarantee changes build before they get to main
Limit who can contribute to specific branches
Enforce who can create branches and the naming guidelines for the branches
Automatically include the right reviewers for every code change
Enforce best practices with required code reviewers

Use feature branches for all new features and bug fixes.
Merge feature branches into the main branch using pull requests.
Keep a high quality, up-to-date main branch.
